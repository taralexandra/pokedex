# Project Pokedex API :ledger:

My goal with this project was to make a training with an all new subject for me : API, i recently started to study.

I was looking for something fun and interesting and i found this fun project using an API about Pokemon, this is a tutorial, made by Kenny Yip Coding on his [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/dVtnFH4m_fE?si=43bnUM3D26mQgkrE).

I decided to change some elements mainly related to the design, then I added images and an easer egg surprise...

The background image i choose for this project is from [Freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/gradient-spring-landscape-concept_6880829.htm#fromView=search&page=1&position=42&uuid=ce45e699-0145-4a67-890f-3b44716d2b85&query=Background+cartoon+grass)(the attribution is required, so here it is).

The Favicon is from Icon8, a yellow star with a pokeball in the middle.

## Take a look !
